# [JSL08] Submission: Singleton Pattern for Bank Branch Management

# Project Overview

- In this project, I used the Singleton pattern to manage the bank's branch information. A Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. I used the Singleton pattern to merge the bank's branch information for the banking system.

# Elements Included

- Code that includes the necessary modifications to meet the project requirements.
- GitHub repository that contains the updated code files.

# Reflections

## Areas of Mastery

- There aren't any areas of mastery as this was my first time implementing a specific design pattern in my project. I plan to continue to practice and learn more about design patterns in the future so that I can confidently say that I have mastered them.

## Challenges faced

- I had a hard time understanding the Singleton pattern. I had to do a lot of research to understand the pattern and even though I was able to finish the project, there is still a lot more to learn.

## Areas of Improvement

- I would like to improve my understanding of the Singleton pattern and be able to design my own function with this pattern in future projects.

# Overall Learning Experience

- I found this project to be very challenging and tricky. It was a bit complicated to get branchB to log branchA's information. I believe with more practice and time, I will be able to understand singleton patterns better and create my own function with this pattern.
